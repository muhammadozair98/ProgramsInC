***ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS***
 Question 1:
     Which hash table collision resolution method did you use
     (eg. chaining or open addressing)? Explain your choice
     briefly (less than 25 words).
 YOUR ANSWER:

 The hash table collision resolution method I used was open addressing. It was much easier to implement for my code. 
 
 
 
 
 Question 2:
       Which hash function (division or multiplication) did you use?
       How did you convert a string into a number?
 YOUR ANSWER:

I used the Division hash function. It converted the string into number, the letters for ascii values were used.
 
 
 Question 3:
       Another legal XML tag not used in this lab is the
       stand-alone tag.  This kind of tag
       combines both a start-tag and end-tag in one.
       It is identified with a '/' (slash) preceding the
       final >.  (For example, the <foo/>
       is a stand-alone tag that is self balancing.
       
       Describe briefly how
       you would modify Part 3 to allow this kind of tag.
       
 YOUR ANSWER:

In order to implement a stand-alone tag for part 3, we would have to add another condition to 
test the string if it has a "/" after the character at the beginning of the code. If it does then the start tag and the end tag would be combined and would be valid , as previously 
done with the string "/" for part3.
