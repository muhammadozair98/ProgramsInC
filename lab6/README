My program works correctly. You can input any integer values and once you are done, press Ctrl+D to get the last Reading Input value you entered, then press Ctrl+D again to get the  Heap tree structure as XML and the integers back in sorted and reverse-sorted order.

You can test out a file called "codingtest" with the same integer values from the lab manuel. 
By doing "heap<codingtest"
