1. This is a brief summary for this lab:

What I did in this lab was to make my insertion sort and merge sort code with the given guidelines. The codes that I implemented worked without any errors for InsertionSort and MergeSort. I used a file named "codingtest" to test if my codes sort out the numbers without errors. 

2. InsertionSort Theoretical analysis:

These are the equations for the worst, best, average case inputs of n. 

worst: O(n^2)
best: O(n)
avaerage: O(n^2)

3. MergeSort Theoretical analysis:

These are the equations for the worst, best, average case inputs of n. 

worst: O(n log(n))
best: O(n log(n))
avaerage: O(n log(n))
