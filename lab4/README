This is my personal state machine:

A F B
B D F
C H D
D C E
E A E
F G H
G B C
H E G

Your starting state is: F 

Most of my program code works. However I am having just a few probelms with the garbage command. As I tested my program out, It seems that when I press the command 'g', the state is already on the list of garbage states if I just change 1 input of a State. This only happened a few times with certain states.
